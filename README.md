# Google-SecOps

## Background

This project was my IT Capstone project in collaboration with Cybriant, a company based in Atlanta which provides customized prevention, detection, and remediation of cyber threats and attacks leveraging AI enabled technologies. I accomplished this project as the team leader of a group of 5 in total. My role was to assign tasks, research and implement solutions to complete the project, ensure effective comunication between the team, the sponsors and the professor, and finally, monitor team progression towards the completion of the project.

### Project Objectives


This project objectives were to: 

-Develop a threat hunting IDS sensor capable of analyzing traffic, performing vulnerability scans, and aggregating logs.
-Integrate the OwlH project into Google SecOps, including a parser development for translating OwlH and OpenVAS outputs into Googleâ€™s Unified Data Model (UDM).
-Implement a management system for OpenVAS to automate vulnerability scanning across infrastructure devices.
-Enhance log aggregation capabilities and develop a shipping function to streamline data management within Google SecOps.
